1. Arithmetic Operators:
Arithmetic operators can perform arithmetical operations on numeric operands involved.

Operator Description

+                  Add
–                  Subtract
*                  Multiply
/                  Division
%                Modulus

Examples:

i. Add (+)
SELECT 30 + 20;

ii. Subtract (-)
SELECT 30 – 20;

iii. Multiply (*)
Select 30 * 20;

iv. Division
Select 40 / 20;

v. Modulus (%)
Select 40 % 19;

2. Comparison Operators:
A comparison (or relational) operator is a mathematical symbol that is used to compare between two values.

Comparison operators are used in conditions that compare one expression with another. The result of a comparison can be TRUE, FALSE, or UNKNOWN (an operator that has one or two NULL expressions returns UNKNOWN).

The following table describes different types of comparison operators

Operator Description

=                  Equal to
>                  Greater than
<                  Less than
>=                Greater than or equal to
<=               Less than or equal to
<>               Not equal to

Examples:

i. Select * From abcd
Where City=’Pune’;

ii. Select * From abcd
Where Age > 25;

iii. Select * From abcd
Where Age >= 25;

iv. Select * From abcd
Where Age < 25;

v. Select * From abcd
Where Age <= 25;

vi. Select * From abcd
Where Age <> 25;

3. Logical Operators:
There are three Logical Operators namely, AND, OR, and NOT. These operators compare two conditions at a time to determine whether a row can be selected for the output. When retrieving data using a SELECT statement, You can use logical operators in the WHERE clause, which allows you to combine more than one condition.

Operator	Description
ALL TRUE	if all of the sub-query values meet the condition
AND TRUE	if all the conditions separated by AND is TRUE
ANY  TRUE	if any of the sub-query values meet the condition
BETWEEN TRUE	if the operand is within the range of comparisons
EXISTS TRUE	if the sub-query returns one or more records
IN TRUE	if the operand is equal to one of a list of expressions
LIKE TRUE	if the operand matches a pattern Try it
NOT	 Displays a record if the condition(s) is NOT TRUE
OR TRUE	 if any of the conditions separated by OR is TRUE
SOME TRUE	 if any of the sub-query values meet the condition
Examples:

i. And
Select * From abcd
Where Age > 25 And City =’Hyderabad’;

ii. Or
Select * From abcd
Where Age > 40 Or City =’Pune’;

iii. Between
Select * From abcd
