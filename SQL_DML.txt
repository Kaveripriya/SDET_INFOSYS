The SELECT Statement is used to select data from a database. The result is stored in a result table, called the result-set.

The SELECT command is the most commonly used command in SQL. It allows database users to retrieve the specific information they desire from an operational database.

/* Select Syntax

Select colomn1, column2, …
From Table_Name;

Select * From Table_Name; */

Select Id, Name From abcd;

Select * From abcd;

2. Insert:
The INSERT INTO Statement is used to insert new records in a table. We can insert data to a table in two ways,

Syntax
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2 …)
VALUES (value1, value2, …);

Example:
Insert Into abcd (Id, Name, City)
values(4, ‘Vijaya’, ‘Kavali’);
—————–
Insert Data Only in Specified Columns

Insert Into abcd (Name)
values (‘Cinnu’);
Note: If you insert a specified column only then the remaining columns are Null…

3. Update:
The UPDATE statement is used to update existing records in a table.

Syntax:

UPDATE table_name

SET column1=value, column2=value2,…
WHERE some_column=some_value

Example:

Update abcd
Set Name = ‘Venkat’, City = ‘Mumbai’
Where Id = 1;

4. Delete:
The SQL DELETE Query is used to delete the existing records from a table. You can use the WHERE clause with the DELETE query to delete selected rows, otherwise, all the records would be deleted.

Syntax:

DELETE FROM table_name [WHERE condition];

Example:

Delete From abcd
Where Id = 4;

Delete From abcd;
